All new system calls (outside of those previously added manually)
will be added in their own c files and documented here. In the future
I intend to mix the XNU and Linux methods of system call declaration
into this setup so that not everything has to be explicitly declared here
and can be written into different files around the source tree as need be
	(although I find this to be highly idiotic, but it will allow for
		easier porting of Linux programs and wrapping of system
		calls to make my life easier when troubleshooting and 
		debugging incompatable binaries)
